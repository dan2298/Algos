//Check permutations
// Write a function to check whether two given strings are Permutation of each other or not. 

//Group anagrams
/*Write a function that takes in an array of strings and returns a list of groups of anagrams. Anagrams are strings made up of
exactly the same letters, where order doesn't matter. For example, "cinema" and "iceman" are anagrams; similarly, "foo" and "ofo"
are anagrams. Note that the groups of anagrams don't need to be ordered in any particular way.*/

//isUnique
// Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters

//longestPalindromicSubstring
/*Write a function that, given a string, returns its longest palindromic substring. A palindrome is defined as a string
that is written the same forward and backward. Assume that there will only be one longest palindromic substring.*/

//longestSubstringWithoutDuplication
/*Write a function that takes in a string and that returns its longest substring without duplicate characters. Assume that there
will only be one longest substring without duplication.*/

//oneAway 
/*There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings, insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character.
Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away. */

//palindromePermutation
/* Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same
forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.*/

//rotateMatrix
/*Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is represented by an integer, write a method to rotate
the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place? */

//smallestDifference
/*Write a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of integers. The function should find the pair of numbers (one from the
first array, one from the second array) whose absolute difference is closest to zero. The function should return an array
containing these two numbers, with the number from the first array in the first position. */

//stringCompression
/*Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For examplle, the string aabcccccaaa
would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the
original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowecase letters (a-z).*/

//stringRotation
/* Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code
to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring */
