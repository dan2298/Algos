/*Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List (assume that the list has at least 1 node; in other words, the head will 
never be a null value). The function should reverse the list and return its new head. Note that every node in the Singly Linked List has 
a "value" property storing its value as well as a "next" property pointing to the next node in the list or None (null) if it is the tail 
of the list.*/
