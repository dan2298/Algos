/*Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List that contains a loop (in other words, the list's tail node points to 
some node in the list instead of the None (null) value). The function should return the node (the actual node - not just its value) from 
which the loop originates in constant space. Note that every node in the Singly Linked List has a "value" property storing its value as 
well as a "next" property pointing to the next node in the list. */
